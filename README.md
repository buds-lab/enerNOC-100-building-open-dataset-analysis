###by: [Clayton Miller](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Clayton_Miller2) - Nov, 27 2014
###Part of a series of Commercial Open Building Datasets on [datadrivenbuilding.org](http://datadrivenbuilding.org/)

This Ipython notebook will open and explore the [EnerNOC](http://open.enernoc.com/data/) dataset of 100 anonymized buildings for the 2012 year. The goal of this notebook is to explore and visualize some of the data with the annotation capable in a notebook.

I have always been very interested in the massive amounts of raw data that [EnerNoc](http://www.enernoc.com/) is accumulating -- it would be a dream to play around with that amount and magnitude of data. I was super pleasantly surprised to stumble across  EnerNOC's [*Open Source for an Open Grid*](http://open.enernoc.com/data/) site after reading about it from [Nipun Batra's paper](http://combed.github.io/#portfolio) about commercial building dissaggregation. 

====================

Background  
----------

If you are unfamiliar with IPython Notebook you can start with http://ipython.org/notebook


Installation  
------------

* Prerequisites  
One of the following distributions is needed. Please note that even if you have Python installed it is important to have one of these distributions installed and the binary for this installation in your path. This is because these distributions come packaged with all the supplementary libraries needed and these have been historically difficult to install separately.

  * EPD Free Enthought Python Distribution from http://enthought.com
  * Anaconda Python from http://continuum.io
  * Development has been done on v 1.5 of Anaconda distribution but EPD Free should work just as well.

* The following steps assume you have installed one of the distributions mentioned in prerequisites.

* From a zip or tar file
    * download the zip or tar file 
    * unpack the file to a directory called learnds
    * cd to the 'notebooks' subdirectory
    * start IPython Notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'
 
* From the git repo
    * clone the repo
    * cd to 'notebooks'
    * start IPython Notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'
